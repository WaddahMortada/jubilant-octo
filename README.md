React Native prayer times app

Show prayers times based on phone geo-location (for user current location - latitude and longitude)

Using [sunrise-sunset.org REST API](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api) to get sun info and using [postcodes.io API](https://api.postcodes.io/) to show UK location data

#### Note: I created this repo to play with React Native
